Landing-page-project is my first coding project on github or anywhere.
I created this to upload it on my fiverr gig.
I am new to coding, i have leart HTML through freecodecamp and right now i am learning CSS, and then i will learn more.
My goal is to become a full stack developer by self learning.
Please tell me if i can improve or change something in my first project.
